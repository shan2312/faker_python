# Profile and Stock Market Statistics Generator

## Overview

This Python package provides functionality to generate synthetic profiles and stock market data, and to calculate various statistics based on this generated data. It includes two primary functionalities:

1. **Profile Statistics Calculation**: Generates fake profiles and computes statistics such as the most common blood group, mean latitude and longitude, oldest age, and average age.
2. **Stock Market Statistics Calculation**: Generates fake stock market data for a given number of companies and calculates weighted averages for stock prices.

The generation of fake data is done using the `Faker` library, which allows for the creation of realistic random data.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install faker
```

## Functions

### 1. `calculate_statistics_with_named_tuples(count_profiles: int) -> Tuple`

Generates fake profiles using named tuples and calculates aggregate statistics.

**Arguments:**

- `count_profiles` (int): Number of profiles to generate.

**Returns:**

- `Tuple`: A named tuple containing the following statistics:
  - `largest_blood_group`: The most common blood group among the generated profiles.
  - `mean_lat`: The mean latitude of the current locations.
  - `mean_long`: The mean longitude of the current locations.
  - `oldest_age`: The age of the oldest person in the dataset.
  - `avg_age`: The average age of all profiles.

**Example Usage:**

```python
stats = calculate_statistics_with_named_tuples(1000)
print(stats)
```

### 2. `calculate_statistics_with_dict(count_profiles: int) -> Tuple`

Generates fake profiles using dictionaries and calculates aggregate statistics.

**Arguments:**

- `count_profiles` (int): Number of profiles to generate.

**Returns:**

- `Tuple`: A named tuple containing the following statistics:
  - `largest_blood_group`: The most common blood group among the generated profiles.
  - `mean_lat`: The mean latitude of the current locations.
  - `mean_long`: The mean longitude of the current locations.
  - `oldest_age`: The age of the oldest person in the dataset.
  - `avg_age`: The average age of all profiles.

**Example Usage:**

```python
stats = calculate_statistics_with_dict(1000)
print(stats)
```

### 3. `calculate_stock_market_statistics(count_companies: int) -> Tuple`

Generates fake stock market data for a given number of companies and calculates weighted averages for stock prices.

**Arguments:**

- `count_companies` (int): Number of companies to generate.

**Returns:**

- `Tuple`: A named tuple containing the following statistics:
  - `stock_mkt_open`: The weighted average opening price of the stocks.
  - `stock_mkt_high`: The weighted average highest price of the stocks.
  - `stock_mkt_close`: The weighted average closing price of the stocks.

**Example Usage:**

```python
stock_stats = calculate_stock_market_statistics(100)
print(stock_stats)
```

## Notes

- **Profile Data**:
  - `calculate_statistics_with_named_tuples` and `calculate_statistics_with_dict` both generate profiles with attributes such as blood group, current location (latitude and longitude), and birthdate.
  - The `oldest_age` and `avg_age` are calculated based on the difference between the current date and the birthdate.

- **Stock Market Data**:
  - `calculate_stock_market_statistics` generates stock data with attributes including company name, ticker symbol, opening price, high price, closing price, and a random weight.
  - The weighted averages are calculated based on the random weights assigned to each company.
